### Summary
Our XGBoost model catches 76% of all spam SMS messages a 18% point improvment over the current system (58% -> 76%). This significantly reduces phishing risk. At the same time Of all SMS messages flagged as spam, 89.8% are truly spam, meaning only 1 in 10 SMS in the spam folder is actually legitimate well below the 15% false alarm tolerance
This balance meets both our security and user experience goals


### Monitoring Plan 
- Log all predictions with timestamp and message (anonymized)
- Weekly: recompute precision/recall on new data
- Alert if recall drops below 70% or false alarms exceed 15%
