# Model Evaluation Summary

                Our XGBoost model catches **76% of all spam SMS messages**, a **18% point improvement** over the current system (58% → 76%). This significantly reduces phishing risk.

                At the same time, **89.8% of all SMS messages flagged as spam are truly spam**, meaning only **10.2% (about 1 in 10)** of messages in the spam folder are actually legitimate — well below the 15% false alarm tolerance.

                This balance meets both our security and user experience goals.
